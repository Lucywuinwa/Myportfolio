<h2>Prediction of Insurance Charges</h2>
<p>The purpose of this project is to solve a problem using linear
regression and understand various feature selection and model selection
techniques. In this project we predict the insurance charges based on
different details. The data used in this project can be found <strong><a
href="">here.</a></strong></p>
<p>Information about various parameters such as, age, bmi, smoke,
children etc.</p>
<p>We have to come up with a robust regression model that can predict
the insurance charges.</p>

<p>We sample 80% of the observation for training the regression model

<p>Since the dataset is small, we can use best subset selection for
variable selection. Best subset selection algorithm will look for best
subset of predictors that closely relate with the response variable.
This method may not be best suited when the number of variables are too
large.</p>
<p>We will use-</p>
<ul>
<li>Adjusted R Squared</li>
<li>CP</li>
<li>BIC</li>
</ul>
<p>As creterion for selecting the best subset of predictors for our
linear model.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#Best subset variable selection
best.subset&lt;-regsubsets(charges~.,data = train,nvmax = 7)
best.subset.summary &lt;- summary(best.subset)

# Now, we will use different criterion to select the best subset of the predictors for our problem
# 1. Adjused R squared
p1&lt;-ggplot(data = NULL,aes(x=1:7,y = best.subset.summary$adjr2))+geom_line(color=&#39;white&#39;)+labs(x=&#39;Index&#39;,y=&#39;Adjusted R Squared&#39;,title=&#39;Adjusted R Squared&#39;)+
  theme_hc(bgcolor = &quot;darkunica&quot;)

# 2. CP

  theme_hc(bgcolor = &quot;darkunica&quot;)

# 3. BIC
p3&lt;-ggplot(data = NULL,aes(x=1:7,y = best.subset.summary$bic))+geom_line(color=&#39;white&#39;)+labs(x=&#39;Index&#39;,y=&#39;BIC&#39;,title=&#39;BIC&#39;)+

<p><img src="insurencecharges_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="960" /></p>
<p>From above graphs, it is visible that-</p>
<ul>
<li>Adjusted R Squared increases with index upto index 3, then almost
stays constant</li>
<li>CP gets reduced with index up to 3, then almost stays constant</li>
<li>BIC reduces with index up to 3, later increases gradually</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus,subset with index 3, is the best subset that leads to optimum
results. We will use this subset for our linear model.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># The best model is model with index 3.

fairly accurate as it predicts with close to 98% accuracy.</p>
