My name is Lucy and I am seeking a new opportunity where I can use my skills to gather and analyze data to improve our processes or understand customers better. I enjoy using data to solve problems and make business even better. It’s like being a detective, but instead of solving crimes, I’m solving problems. I am open to learning about new opportunities in the Great Seattle area or remote positions. Please feel free to contact me via email or through LinkedIn messaging. I would be happy to send you my resume.
